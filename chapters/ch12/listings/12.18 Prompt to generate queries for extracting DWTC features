You are a graph database expert specializing in Neo4j and Cypher queries. I'm working on a drug repurposing project and need help generating queries for metapath analysis.

I'll provide you with:
1.  The graph schema (obtained from apoc.meta.schema())
1. An example of the query for CbGaD
2.  A list of metapaths between Compound and Disease nodes
3.  Sample compound and disease names for testing
For each metapath:
- Generate a Cypher query that computes both Path Count (PC) and Degree-Weighted Path Count (DWPC, using damping factor 0.4)
- Include degree calculations for each node in the path
- Return disease_id, disease_name, PC, and DWPC

The schema is:
{Shema definition here or as attachement}

An example of the query for DWPC is:
MATCH path = (c:Compound)-[:BINDS_CbG]-(g)-[:ASSOCIATES_DaG]-(d:Disease)
WHERE c.name = 'Metformin' AND d.name = 'type 2 diabetes mellitus'
WITH
[
  count{(v)-[:BINDS_CbG]-()},
  count{()-[:BINDS_CbG]-(g)},
  count{(g)-[:ASSOCIATES_DaG]-()},
  count{()-[:ASSOCIATES_DaG]-(d)}
]
AS degrees, path, d
WITH
  d.identifier AS disease_id,
  d.name AS disease_name,
  count(path) AS PC,
  sum(reduce(pdp = 1.0, d in degrees| pdp * d ^ -0.4)) AS DWPC
RETURN
  disease_id, disease_name, PC, DWPC

Please generate queries for these metapaths:
- CbGaD (Compound-binds-Gene-associates-Disease)
- CdGuD (Compound-downregulates-Gene-upregulates-Disease)
